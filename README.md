Coursera-Specialization

This specialization program includes 4 courses to get hands-on experience on TensorFlow in various fields just like computer vision, NLP with the helps of applications of CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs.

I did not get the certificate of the courses because of my subscription type, but since I did all excercises, I would prefer to share in here.
